# mutato
A Telegram bot that converts different music links to each other.

I re-used [my first telegram bot](https://github.com/emresaglam/telegrambot) code. I still need to add a ton of error handling and some refactoring. The code is ugly, you have been warned!


You will need to create a .env file. Check out the .env.example in the repo. In this file you should have:
* A TIDAL access token and session id. (Need to describe how you can get those.) 
* A Spotify Client_ID and Client_Secret. Check out developer site for spotify on how to get those. I will not describe it here. 
* A CATAPI_TOKEN if you want to use the cat picture generator. (Too lazy to explain now, soon hopefully)
* A Telegram bot account and a Telegram API as BOTAPI_TOKEN
