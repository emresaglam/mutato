A Telegram bot that converts different music links to each other.

I re-used [my first telegram bot](https://github.com/emresaglam/telegrambot) code. I still need to add a ton of error handling and some refactoring. Thr code is ugly, you have been warned!


You will need:
* TIDAL access token and session id. (Need to describe how you can get those.) 
* Spotify Client_ID and Client_Secret. Check out developer site for spotify on how to get those. I will not descibe it here. 
* Create a .env file in the same folder as the script and put them in that file. Check out the .env.example file
* If you want to use the cat picture generator, you need a CATAPI token. (Too lazy to explain now, soon hopefully)
* You will definitely need Telegram bot account and bot api token.
